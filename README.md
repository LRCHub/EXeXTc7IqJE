No one rollin the way we rock

Large looking like your own
You could be the model type
Skinny with no appetite
Short stack black or white
Long as you do what you like
Body out of site

She does the two step
And her tongue drop
She does the cabbage patch
And the blood stops
She like electro
she know hip hop
She like the reggae
she feel punk rock
She like the samba
and the mamboo
She like to break
dance and calypso
Get a little crazy
Get a little stupid
Get a little crazy crazy crazy
I wanna da I wanna
dance in the lights
I wanna ro I wanna
rock your body
I wanna go I wanna go
for a ride
Hop in the music and
rock your body right
Rock your body right
Rock your body right
